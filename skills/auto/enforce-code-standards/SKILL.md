1. Add type annotations to all parameters and return values for every public function.
2. Ensure all public functions have descriptive docstrings.
3. Check that no original files in protected directories (like `tests/`) are modified unless explicitly required.
4. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with a bulleted entry for every fix or feature added.
5. Run a static analysis or linter check if available to catch missing type hints or style violations.
